# CA284 Systems Programming

This project compares the speed of different sorting algorithms using C. The repo contains a random number generator which will generate a given amount of numbers at random to be sorted. This set of random numbers can be given in random, sorted, reverse or partially sorted order.

To complete this project I also wrote my own implementation of Quicksort, Mergesort and selection sort, while using C's inbuilt qsort for comparison as well. The driver code takes the users' input to produce the random set and then tracks and outputs the time it took for my algorithms to sort that set, allowing the user to compare the results easily. The driver also contains inbuilt error handling.
